"""
Unit test suite for the `regexapp.collection` module.

This package contains all pytest test files dedicated to verifying the
functionality of `regexapp.collection`. Each test ensures that collection
features such as pattern grouping, reference management, and data
aggregation behave as expected.

Structure
---------
- All test files in this folder target components implemented in
  `regexapp/collection.py` and related submodules.
- Tests follow Python's `pytest` conventions for discovery
  and execution.
- Shared utilities from `regexapp.tests.unit` may be imported to
  support consistent test data and reporting.

Usage
-----
Run the full suite with:

    $ pytest regexapp/tests/unit/collection

This ensures that changes to `regexapp.collection` are validated against
expected behavior.
